# WEB601_Project

This is a music website created for my WEB601 course project. It is inspired with the idea of an open source site allowing new artists to upload their music for the community to listen to as a way of making themselves known.


## Setup Instructions

Open first the client then the server folders in the terminal and use 'npm i' in each to setup all needed dependencies.
