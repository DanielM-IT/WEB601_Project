# WEB601_Project

This is a music website created for my WEB601 course project. It is inspired with the idea of an open source site allowing new artists to upload their music for the community to listen to as a way of making themselves known.


## Setup Instructions

Open each of the client and the server in the terminal use <strong> 'npm i' </strong> in each to install all needed dependencies.

To setup the database for use executed the provided sql file in MySQL Workbench. In the config.js file of the server change the user and password to that of your MySQL database login details.


## Start Scripts

To start both the server and the client open each in the terminal and use <strong> 'npm start' </strong>.


This project was initially bootstrapped with Create React App.
